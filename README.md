**A tool to create fake ransomware-style Android APKs that simulate a lock screen using WebView. For educational purposes only.**

---

## 📱 What does this tool do?

FakeDroidLocker is a script-based Android app builder that:

- Asks for custom **App Name**, **Unlock Password**, **Headline**, and **Description**
- Uses your input to generate a fake **Android lock screen app**
- The app opens in fullscreen and prevents back navigation
- Unlocks only when the correct password is entered

⚠️ **This does NOT encrypt or damage any files.** It is just a simulation via WebView.
